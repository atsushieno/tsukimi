* What's this?

This will be a couple of attempt to achieve support for processing[*1] under
moonlight[*2].
[*1] http://processing.org/
[*2] http://mono-project.com/Moonlight

** Plans

	- Write processing parser that parses processing files (*.pde) to
	  the AST.
	- Write "processing foundation library" for common functions and
	  classes.
	- Write code generator that is based on System.Windows.dll.
	  Not sure we generate either of some source code or direct IL.

** Files

processing_syntax.txt is my analysis on processing syntax. It is based on
1.0 beta.

skeleton.cs : taken from mcs (jay).
