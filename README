* What's this?

This will be a couple of attempt to achieve support for processing[*1] under
moonlight[*2].
[*1] http://processing.org/
[*2] http://mono-project.com/Moonlight

** Plans

	- Write processing parser that parses processing files (*.pde) to
	  the AST.
	- Write "processing foundation library" for common functions and
	  classes.
	- Write code generator that is based on System.Windows.dll.
	  Not sure we generate either of some source code or direct IL.

** Some Details

	- *.pde files are parsed to build AstRoot.
	- For each top level contents in AstRoot:
	-- A class is converted to generate a managed class.
	-- A global function definition is converted to a method of Global class.
	-- A statement is converted to become a statement in Global.Run().

** Files

processing_syntax.txt is my analysis on processing syntax. It is based on
1.0 beta.
