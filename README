* What's this?

This will be a couple of attempt to achieve support for processing[*1] under
moonlight[*2].
[*1] http://processing.org/
[*2] http://mono-project.com/Moonlight

** Plans

	- Write processing parser that parses processing files (*.pde) to
	  the AST.
	- Write "processing foundation library" for common functions and
	  classes.
	- Write code generator that is based on System.Windows.dll.
	  Not sure we generate either of some source code or direct IL.

*** Some TODOs

	- Make StandardLibrary as an instance so that global variables and
	  local variables can be distinguished without adding lengthy
	  "StandardLibrary." to global ones.

** Source Files

	- processing_syntax.txt:
	  my analysis on processing syntax. It is based on 1.0 beta.

	- skeleton.cs :
	  taken from mcs (jay).

** Assemblies

	- Proce55ingCli.Core.dll:
	  contains StandardLibrary and fundamental control types.
	- proce55ing2xaml.exe:
	  pde parser and XAML generator, possibly more.

** Parser/Converter

*** Some Details

	- *.pde files are parsed to build AstRoot.
	- "Global" class is generated to hold global members.
	- For each top level contents in AstRoot:
	-- A class is converted to generate a managed class.
	-- A global function definition is converted to a method of Global class.
	-- A statement is converted to become a statement in Global.Run().
