This directory can be used to test processingimporter against Ben Fry's
"Visualizing Data" examples.
http://benfry.com/writing/archives/3

To retrieve examples, download zip files from there:

wget http://benfry.com/writing/map/ch03-usmap.zip
wget http://benfry.com/writing/series/ch04-milkteacoffee.zip
wget http://benfry.com/writing/salaryper/ch05-salaryper.zip
wget http://benfry.com/writing/zipdecode/ch06-zipdecode.zip
wget http://benfry.com/writing/treemap/ch07-hierarchies.zip
wget http://benfry.com/writing/graphlayout/ch08-graphlayout.zip

Note that a lot of samples won't work since they are dependent on Java.
(see ../README for more details.)
