With the utility script "create-sample.sh", you can easily try examples
from processing project (download from svn):

<run>
cd processing.org
wget http://dev.processing.org/source/index.cgi/*checkout*/trunk/processing/build/shared/examples.zip
unzip examples.zip
./create-sample.sh Array examples/Basics/Arrays/Array/Array.pde
</run>


You can also try samples from "Visualizing Data" by Ben Fry.

So far, some of chapter 3 and chapter 4 would work.
Though in chapter 4 there are some extra dependencies on Java syntax.
Comment out those lines that contain "throw" statements.

There are also dependencies on Java classes such as Float.
For Float, you can put the equivalent code below as "Float.cs" :

<code>
using System;

public class Float
{
	public const double MAX_VALUE = float.MaxValue;

	public static bool isNaN (double value)
	{
		return value == double.NaN;
	}
}
</code>

Once you create above, then run processingimporter.exe. It calls mxap and
it automatically compiles Float.cs too.
